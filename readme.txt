###What is this?  
I got sick of remaking the standard wordpress theme directory structure and forgetting useful yet inconsistently named php & wordpress functions, so I have been cultivating this quick and dirty theme folder for a few years. The idea is that after you've installed a fresh copy of the latest wordpress for a client / site / whatever, you can quickly get a theme ready to work on by changing a few values in the style.css and uploading it to the themes directory and activating it.  
  
###The goal of this project:  
The goal is simple. To have a project you can download, rename a few things, and then upload to your new wordpress install to begin working on building the layout.  
  
I want there to be a cheat-sheet text file included with some useful snippets of code that I use all the time, like how to sort posts using query_posts, adding menus and widget spaces, defining page templates, dealing with custom meta's on posts, feature images, and writing theme specific shortcodes.  
  
I also want it to include the latest stable versions of JQuery, JQueryUI, Colorbox, etc etc but in a way that I can remove what I don't need easily.
