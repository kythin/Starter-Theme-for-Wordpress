## Starter Theme for Wordpress

###What is this?  
I got sick of remaking the standard wordpress theme directory structure and forgetting useful yet inconsistently named php & wordpress functions, so I have been cultivating this quick and dirty theme folder for a few years. The idea is that after you've installed a fresh copy of the latest wordpress for a client / site / whatever, you can quickly get a theme ready to work on by changing a few values in the style.css and uploading it to the themes directory and activating it.  
  
###The goal of this project:  
The goal is simple. To have a project you can download, rename a few things, and then upload to your new wordpress install to begin working on building the layout.  
  
I want there to be a cheat-sheet text file included with some useful snippets of code that I use all the time, like how to sort posts using query_posts, adding menus and widget spaces, defining page templates, dealing with custom meta's on posts, feature images, and writing theme specific shortcodes.  
  
I also want it to include the latest stable versions of JQuery, JQueryUI, Colorbox, etc etc but in a way that I can remove what I don't need easily.

Quick Start:  
------------  
  
1. Open style.css and edit the values up the top. Try to keep the Theme Name as one word or use hyphens for spaces, as it makes it more foolproof to rename the folder later.  
2. Open functions.php and add your Google Analytics code if you want to (or take note to add it when you're done). There's example functions in there too so have a quick look through it.
3. Rename the theme folder to match your Theme Name, and upload it to the themes directory on your wordpress install.
4. Activate it, and begin your development on your dev server (or production if you really want to, but I don't recommend it!).  
  
  
There is a copy of the Wordpress Heirachy and a Snippets.txt file that also can come in handy.  
  
  
Enjoy!
