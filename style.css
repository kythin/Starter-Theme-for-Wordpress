Written by Chris Samios ( www.kythin.com )

https://github.com/kythin/Starter-Theme-for-Wordpress

The base theme used to build this wordpress theme is a freely available, GPL3 licenced project designed to speed the process of building wordpress themes. This is not designed to be a base for themes that go onto marketplaces, as the GPLv3 will not allow you to sell any theme you make with this base project. However, it IS ok to charge a client for your time, and then build their theme using this basic structure. That's exactly what it is intended for!
